As a programmer
I can create a new note
So I can record something I need to remember

As a programmer
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters
So I can find the one I want

As a programmer
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page
So I can see all the information in the note

As a programmer
I can use shortcodes like `:fire:` that get converted into emojis like ðŸ”¥
So I can record notes with fun little pictures


1. Testing
2. Individual notes on their own page
3. Shortcodes/APIs << this one
