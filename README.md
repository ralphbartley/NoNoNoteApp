*Introduction*

In this project we will be creating a single page web application using only JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Our aim is to create an interactive note taking application allowing users to create, save, edit and delete notes in a easy to use way.

We have stylised our web application with fun characters and made use of animations to bring life to our page and create a fun interactive experience for our users. Users can make use of emoji shortcodes which we have implemented with the use of an external API. Local storage has also been implemented making sure that notes persist after the page has been reloaded, therefore increasing the functionality of our web application.

To ensure that our Back End code works as intended we have created a testing framework which produces Fail/Pass results and guarantees the quality of our code.

*Goals*

- Create a functional and easy to use product
- Create a functional testing framework
- Clear interface
- Style our web application to match our mock up
- Clean code (DRY)
