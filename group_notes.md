- Our group will have four roles that rotate on a daily basis
  - Scrum master (stand-up 2pm)
    - Suggest/lead the day's direction
    - Ensures
  - Archivist (updates README & group_notes)
    -
  -
- We will use Trello to record:
  - Planning, Pairing, Progress
- Modelling:
  - We will take the user stories and break them down into their Properties and Actions, and break this into Model and Front-end tasks.
    - After breaking the four stories down, we decide that the first three are the MVP.
    - We break down the front-end, interface, and back-end into basic functionality tasks.
  - Break into groups Front-end (Nata and Jack) and Model (Taran and Ralph) to mock-up and CRC model respectively
    - Create [CRC](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1guD8SyOlWQf3N3Usl9Pf2uQdFOrgNzlTbOdiAJif6K0/edit#gid=0) cards.
      - Break down tasks into issues and input into GitHub, noting down further than MVP functionality we might include.  Group issues into MVP milestone so we can assign issues to pairs when we break out to do work.
    - [Front-end mockups](https://framer.com/projects/Get-Started--1RrNyvVjFtWO23CGchx4-ecYPl?node=m2dHJyJ9X) for user journeys based on user stories.
